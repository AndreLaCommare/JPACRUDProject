# JPA CRUD Project

# Description
This JPA CRUD Project is intended to demonstrate our ability to create and manage a one table database, in my case, a UFC Fighter database, that functions very similarly to last week's Spring MVC Boot project, however with different technologies, primarily when it comes to communicating with and accessing entities from within the database. From a web page that is formatted using JSP the user is provided with a list of fighters from the database, all as hyperlinks to their respective fighter pages. The User may also look enter an integer in a form to search for a fighter by their id. Beneath the list of fighters is another form with the fields each fighter has in order to create a fighter, though only a name is required for a fighter to be created. And finally a Delete and update function exists for each fighter where the former returns the user to the homepage while the latter redirects to a page with another form located on a seperate jsp that displays the fighters current info but with the opportunity to overwrite it, returning the user home after updating the fighter.

# Lessons Learned
This project highlighted the utility and ease of JPAs and their ability to persist data to the database. Specifically EntityManagerFactory that in turn creates and EntityManager greatly simplifiesd the process of communicating data to the database, while also providing clarity on the flow of code. This project one of the most difficult aspects of last week's the ability to update a database, and reduced hundreds of lines of code to tens of lines with far more readability and modulability. nother lesson with this project is the importance of reading and understanding JPQL and SQL queries, because, while they are incredibly similar there were several moments where I was utilizing SQL syntax in an attemot to access an entity but needed JPQL and its Java oriented syntax. Finally this project emphasized the value and necessity of having JUnit Tests in order to ensure you are accessing and assigning (mapping) fields of an entity properly, for instance, mapping two VARCHAR columns to eachother may not cause issues syntactically and will compile without issue but will be caught by a well-written JUnit test if the programmer puts in the time and effort.
